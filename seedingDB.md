Working with nkowaokwu:

## Docker

Had to download Docker before the `yarn start:docker` would work.


Signing up to Docker, downloading it, craeting a user account, then the yarn command. This started the server and downloaded 2 million gb of stuff. Window opens.

Then I started with yarn dev to start the project.

**Seeding**
Had to 'seed' the database using POSTMAN to the url supplied http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test/populate in order for it to download the content.
